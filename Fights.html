    Strategic Plan 2022 - 2026
A strategic plan for Wrestling, UWW and its Members has been developed for the next five years and consists in putting additional resources - time, money and people, towards five key focus areas.

Youth Engagement

Women's Wrestling

Associated Styles

Image of Wrestling

Digital Transformation

These areas were chosen following a comprehensive outreach programme and deep analysis of the results.
 We asked questions and the Wrestling community answered. By speaking to national federations and other stakeholders, 
 United World Wrestling was able to capture a true understanding of the key challenges and opportunities that currently exist
