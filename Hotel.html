    Dwarika’s Hotel is a unique place in South Asia. It is a living example of how cultural restoration and tourism can complement each other, leading to the preservation of historical artifacts and the growth of a rich cultural industry, earning its esteemed title of a living museum. What began as an impulsive action grew into a passion, and soon Dwarika Das Shrestha’s commitment to saving, documenting and restoring artifacts took on a life of its own. He envisioned, the ancient Newari style houses using the rescued carvings will treasure a new lease of life and the appreciation of Nepal’s ancient cultural history will live on forever.
