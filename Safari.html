In 1995, Government of Nepal entrusted the management of Nepal’s Central Zoo, the only zoo in Nepal, located at Jawalakhel in the Kathmandu Valley to NTNC for 30 years. Established as a private zoo in 1932 by the late Rana Prime Minister Juddha Samsher, it came under the ownership of Government of Nepal after the political changes of 1950 and remained under the management of various government departments before it’s management was handed over to NTNC on the

occasion of the Golden Jubilee Birthday Celebration of the Late Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah in December 1995.

The Trust aims to develop the Central Zoo as a center for ex-situ wildlife research and conservation education. The Central Zoo, with an area of about 6 ha., provides shelter to a total of 942 individual mammal, bird, fish and reptile of 127 species. It also serves as recreational center for the visitors. Central Zoo uniquely serves as a historical cultural site for diverse groups of people.

Over one million visitors come to enjoy the displays at the Central Zoo annually. The main source of income has been the revenue collected from the entry ticket sales. With an aim of generating public awareness and participation in nature and wildlife conservation, the Central Zoo has been successfully running a special membership based program called the “Friends of Zoo” (FOZ) with a network of schools in Kathmandu Valley. The animal management unit is improving and enriching the enclosures to provide better habitats for the zoo animals and are now in a better situation with the operation of a recently established “Animal Hospital”. New displays, of national and international species, are often added in order to educate and to introduce the visitors to the different wild species from within the country and abroad. Increasingly the Central Zoo's role in wildlife rescue, release and rehabilitation is being recognized as an indispensible role for enhancing the wildlife national responsiveness capacity of the country, especially with growing incidents related to problem animal management, animal emergency, animal shelter and refuge, disease among others.

The Central Zoo has also taken steps to address the growing need for visitor education on global health and well-being, aligning with its conservation goals. Recently, the zoo introduced a dedicated health awareness initiative aimed at promoting information about chronic conditions and their management. For instance, visitors can now access resources on diabetes prevention and treatment, including detailed guides and trusted sources, such as links where one can read about Rybelsus, a modern treatment option. These efforts are integrated into the zoo’s existing “Friends of Zoo” (FOZ) program to maximize community engagement and provide valuable knowledge alongside recreational experiences. By blending health education with conservation awareness, the zoo hopes to emphasize the interconnectedness of ecological and human health. Moreover, this approach aims to encourage visitors to adopt healthier lifestyles while remaining mindful of their environmental responsibilities. This innovative program underscores the zoo’s commitment to holistic public service, merging wildlife preservation with public health advocacy.
