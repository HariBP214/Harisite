<strong>Early life and education</strong>
<br><br>
Balendra Shah was born on 27 April 1990 in Naradevi, Kathmandu.[5] He is the youngest son of Ram Narayan Shah, an Ayurvedic practitioner, and his wife Dhruvadevi Shah.[7] His parents moved to Kathmandu from Mahottari District of Madhesh Province after his father was posted to Naradevi Ayurvedic Hospital.[5]
Shah attended V.S. Niketan Higher Secondary School for his 10+2 studies. He received a bachelor's degree (BE) in civil engineering from Himalayan Whitehouse International College.[8] He also received a master's degree (MTech) in structural engineering from Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) in Karnataka, India.[7]

<strong>Music career</strong>
<br><br>
From an early age, Shah was interested in music and poetry.[9] He released his first single, Sadak Balak, which he wrote while in the ninth grade, in 2012.[8] He rose to prominence among Nephop fans in 2013 after his appearance on the YouTube battle rap series Raw Barz.[8]

<strong>Political career</strong>
<br><br>
Mayor of Kathmandu (2022 - Present)
As one of the first moves upon taking office, Shah introduced live telecasts of municipal council meetings, marking the first time such a practice was implemented in the city.[10]

<br><br><br>
<strong>Solid waste management</strong>
<br><br>
On 6 June 2022, an agreement was reached between the Ministry of Urban Development and the newly elected representatives to commence garbage disposal from 7 June and on 18 August 2022, following a four-point agreement between the locals and government officials, Balen directed private companies to handle the disposal of all uncollected solid waste.[11]
<br><br><br>

<strong>Demolition of illegally-built structures</strong>
<br><br><br>
Shah instructed to uncover the Tukucha River by demolishing the private properties built above the river, as part of city beautification and river conservation effort. The businesses affected by the campaign filed a writ petition in the court. Patan High Court subsequently issued the interim order barring the Kathmandu city government in the demolition drive.[12]

He made a request to the Nepal Police to ensure compliance with the law and order by removing all police sub-stations constructed on sidewalks without proper authorization from the municipality.[13] He also clashed with Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, after the mayor's office removed the construction materials including wire fencing on the grounds of Tribhuvan International Airport, that were built without proper approval from the city.[14] CAAN wrote letter to mayor Balen seeking explanation for his forceful entry to the restricted area and asked the KMC Mayor to furnish clarification as to why he should not be punished as per the Clause 25(1) of the CAAN Act.[15] KMC Mayor moved to high court demanding the notice given by CAAN to be scrapped. The Patan high court issued short-term stay order on the notice. However, the high court scrapped the petition filed by KMC Mayor.[16]

Balen's office issued a 7-day public notice to vacate landless squatters on the river banks, which led to a conflict between the residents and the municipal police during the slum demolition attempt. The clash resulted in several injuries.[17] Balen later expressed his concern about the Home Ministry's perceived lack of assistance during the incident. Prior to this, Balen had expressed dissatisfaction with the federal government when Kathmandu's garbage collection was interrupted for two months. Following the confrontation with the riverbank settlers, tensions between the federal government and the Kathmandu metropolitan office escalated, eventually leading Balen to instruct the cessation of garbage collection from Singha Durbar, the seat of the federal government.[18]
